The Utah Arch research group is involved in Computer Architecture and VLSI Research at the School of Computing, University of Utah. Led by Dr. Rajeev Balasubramonian, Dr. Erik Brunvand, and Dr. Vijay Nagarajan the group explores many aspects of modern and future computing systems. The group's current research focuses on memory systems, machine learning accelerators, neuromorphic architectures, hardware ray-tracing, and memory security.
